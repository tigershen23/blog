The fourteen months before my high school graduation in June were the craziest

-	Before: doing basketball, loving it
-	Stuff I did since:
	-	graduate high school a year early by completing 12 courses for a total of 120 units, 10 of which were AP or college level
	-	gotten an almost-perfect score on the ACT (one question off!)
	-	holding down an engineering internship at Caviar
	-	programmed at least 40 hours a week
	-	applied to three colleges and 25+ jobs
	-	and ultimately, landed an amazing position as a Software Engineer at Braintree Payments (owned by PayPal), where I'm super excited to start next week.

Burned me out. Now, I want to write about it. Reflections, stories, takeaways, shoutouts, and resources that helped me.

My main goals are to chronicle my experiences for the future, and to hopefully entertain or help some people by doing it publicly.

Cheers, Tiger

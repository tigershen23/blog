## Intro

* Graduated in June, going to begin working full-time instead of going right into 

## Marketable Skills

* Will the market for programmers be like this in 4 or 5 years? Definitely not a given.
* 

## Industry vs. Academia

* Disclaimer: I, obviously, have not gone through the whole CS degree thing, so I can only speak from what I've heard and what I've done in industry - APCS?
* http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/119470/differences-between-programming-in-school-vs-programming-in-industry
* In my experience, everything happens more quickly and on a larger scale at an exciting company vs. in a classroom. At work, I think I can make a bigger impact and also learn a lot more than by reading textbooks.

## MOOCs

* MOOCs, or Massively Open Online Courses

## But still...

* Social aspect - still might be strong enough to pull me in. This extends to academics, where philosophy or business or economics are all on the table
* Unique opportunity of being able to go to work - but I did it with about 2 years of hard work on my own while being a full-time student
* I mentioned that I got rejected by my top choice, and I would've gone, but that was then and this is now.

* Meet people your own age with different world-views or ethnic/financial/geographic/political backgrounds.

##  Conclusion

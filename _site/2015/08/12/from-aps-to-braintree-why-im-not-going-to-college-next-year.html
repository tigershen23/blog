  <li>In my experience, everything happens more quickly and on a larger scale at an exciting company vs. in a classroom. At work, I think I can make a bigger impact and also learn a lot more than by reading textbooks.</li>

  <li>Social aspect - still might be strong enough to pull me in. This extends to academics, where philosophy or business or economics are all on the table</li>
  <li>Unique opportunity of being able to go to work - but I did it with about 2 years of hard work on my own while being a full-time student</li>
  <li>I mentioned that I got rejected by my top choice, and I would’ve gone, but that was then and this is now. </li>

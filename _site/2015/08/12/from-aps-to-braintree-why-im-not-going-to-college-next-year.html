				<h2 class="content">From AP's to Braintree: Why I'm not Going to College Next Year</h2>
				<section>
					<p>I graduated from high school in June, and am going to begin working full-time instead of jumping into college. I’ve been asked why many times, and I’ve thought about it myself a lot. The clearest reasoning I can provide from my personal experience boils down to the opportunity cost in several areas. </p>

<h3 id="opportunity-cost-of-time">Opportunity Cost of Time</h3>

<p>4 years is a lot of time to someone who’s only been around for 16 of them, able to read and write for 12, allowed to sit in the front seat of the car for 5, and can’t yet vote in America. I look at everything I’ve done in the last 15 months (LINK TO OTHER POST), and it becomes hard to justify setting aside four years with the primary goal of getting a piece of paper. Time is the most valuable asset I have, and I believe that spending it with people and on things that are truly meaningful or impactful (vs. what a professor or textbook thinks should be) is the best thing for me. Yes, many of these activities are available to college students (sports - intramurals, travel - study abroad, music - marching band) - but under the umbrella goal of doing well in classes to get a degree. My priority is to craft a productive and fulfilling next four years of my life, and with all of that time in my control, I’m betting on my own ability to make it happen.  </p>

<h3 id="opportunity-cost-of-impact">Opportunity Cost of Impact</h3>

<p>To this point, I can only speak on the skill I have and will be using to earn my salary. Many keystrokes have been spilled on the topic of programming in industry vs. in academia/to get a Computer Science degree (for example, <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/119470/differences-between-programming-in-school-vs-programming-in-industry">here</a> and <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/12589/graduate-expectations-versus-reality">here</a>), and I can’t say much more than what’s already been said. Beyond the transitional pains some people seem to face jumping from school to work, I’m looking forward to working on projects at Braintree that make a larger impact than what my Intro to CS final project might ever have a chance to. I read about undergraduates at elite universities doing awesome things in the news every week. Moving <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/q4-2014-recap/">$22,800,000,000</a> around is the kind of tangible impact that makes me feel like I’m doing something awesome as well. </p>

<h3 id="opportunity-cost-of-learning">Opportunity Cost of Learning</h3>

<p>At first glance, this is a clear win for the go-to-college camp. After all, universities are billed as places of higher <em>education</em>. Attending college would thus seem to be the best way for someone like me, who likes learning, to do just that - learn. However, the more I look at things, the more I feel like I can learn just as much, if not more, without going to school for the strict purpose of doing so. </p>

<p>The opportunities to gain practical knowledge through work speak for themselves. As alluded to while discussing the opportunity cost of impact, it’s hard for me to imagine a 200-person lecture hall matching the scale, pace, and talent/mentorship of an exciting company. The links I dropped there speak for themselves - I’ll learn to more effectively build maintainable, scalable, <em>new</em> software in an environment where the nature of the product <em>demands</em> a grasp of these principles. The soft skills - collaboration, communication, negotiation - are all placed under stress and come out stronger on the other side. </p>

<p>Even the theoretical technical knowledge that was previously confined to classrooms is now available to me on the internet - and almost all of it is free! The rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a>, or Massive Open Online Courses, means a huge knowledge-sharing effort from the most prestigious universities to you and me. I’m making my way through Coursera’s excellent <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">“Algorithms, Part 1”</a>. It’s the same class that Princeton students take, literally taught by the guy who wrote the book on the subject. If that’s not quality, I don’t know what is. The viability of these courses has been heavily debated (<a href="http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/ele/2014/03/25/whats-the-benefit-of-moocs/">they’re great!</a>, <a href="http://www.learndash.com/4-downsides-to-moocs/">boooo</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edtechdev/considering-moo-cs-16842646">let’s consider all sides</a>), but all other variables being equal (which they more or less are), their effectiveness comes down to the same thing as any taught in a physical classroom - each individual student’s motivation and eagerness to learn. Heck, <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">this guy</a> completed the <em>entire</em> MIT Computer Science curriculum in a year without stepping foot on campus. It’s not a stretch to imagine that I might learn as much or even more by not attending college as I could by doing so.</p>

<h3 id="opportunity-cost-of-money">Opportunity Cost of Money</h3>

<p>Money - always a sticky topic when it comes to college, and one that, as a lifetime financial dependent, I may not be super qualified to speak on. Beyond tuition and room &amp; board, The opportunity cost for me also includes my income over the years that I would otherwise be a student. Some basic napkin math is enough to convince me that this sum is, at the least, non-trivial, and potentially very lucrative for a young man without significant financial obligations. This is not even to mention the value of years of experience vs. years in college in terms of open doors and opportunities, even in a programmers’ market as hot as the one now.</p>

<p>Another factor for me is the ripple effect to my immediate surroundings. By taking away the costs associated with my college education and 4 more years of financial dependence, I can set my parents up for an earlier and more comfortable retirement (trust me, they deserve it!) and enable my little brother to attend a more expensive private university that he might not otherwise have been able to without loans. All, as I’ve explored, with little to no detriment to my own livelihood. </p>

<p>I’m blessed to be able to consider money relatively low on my list of decision-making factors, but from where I stand the ROI of shelling out three fingers, a toe, and my parents’ savings, don’t really match up with the potential financial benefits both personally and for people I care about. College is a large financial investment, and just like with my time, I feel like I can get more out of my money by investing it more directly on my own life.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>It remains the case that had I gotten into Stanford last Fall (LINK TO OTHER POST), I would be super excited to schedule my classes and move into the dorms right about now. But I didn’t, and a lot has happened since then to change my opinion on the viability of college; I was accepted into two other top-10 Computer Science programs in the Spring, and decided to decline their offers of admission without much consideration. As it stands, the opportunity costs of going to college in the areas of time, impact, learning, and $$ are all prohibitive for me. I tried to keep this short, so just let me know if you’d like me to explore any parts of this topic further. </p>

<p>I should also mention that, despite all this, I do plan on submitting college applications again this fall. The social aspect of college - interacting with bright people my own age with different backgrounds - is a strong pull. In addition, too many people that I highly respect have told me to go to college for me to fully dismiss it yet. Because I graduated from high school a year early, I have the unique opportunity of deciding to go to college a year or even two later and not miss a beat. </p>

<p>Well, I hope some of what I’ve touched upon here was interesting or helpful. Say something nice to someone today.</p>

<p>P.S. There are plenty of disclaimers to make here. Yes, I do not have firsthand experience . Everyone’s situation is different and I (obviously) don’t have firsthand college experience to draw from. And to those that would raise objections to points I’ve brought up based on my lack of ethos…I’d love to chat! Contact info in the footer.</p>

title: Balance
---

I'm taking seven AP classes (nine total). I'm lucky to have an internship where I get to contribute and do something I love, but the excitement of working can detract from my academic performance. I need to exercise and sleep. I have to spend time with my family. Friends? Whenever I can fit them in. The fact that I've been able to sit down here and write for a bit is a miracle in itself. 

I don't mean to brag. Doing all of this isn't even really something to be proud of. What I want to get at is _balance_. What's the best way to balance everything in my life? At this point, I don't think there is one. I've already made sacrifices in order to manage my current workload. I can't see a way to avoid making a lot more. The scales are going to have to be tipped one way or another More time with friends, less time to learn. More sleep, less NBA 2k. My scales are heavily leaning towards school and work right now, and I'm coming closer to just accepting that for as long as it's necessary. If it all pays off, then hey, hopefully we can swing on over to the "more fun" side of things. Cheers.
